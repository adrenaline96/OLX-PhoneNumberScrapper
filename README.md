# OLX.ro-PhoneNumberScrapper

The code presented here was published to serve as a point of reference for those interested in developing their own program.

The "ExtractAd" method takes a list of links in this format:
"https://www.olx.ro/auto-masini-moto-ambarcatiuni/?page=<<page no>>"
It returns a list with ads that it finds. 

The "ExtractNumbers" method takes the list of ads you gathered earlier, and populates a ListView with with phone numbers and corresponding user names.

This code used to work in 2018. It no longer works, but can serve as a starting point for those who are interesting in creating their own scrapper.
